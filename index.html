        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p class="bio">All my life, I have been curious about how the world around me operates. However, simply being intrigued was not enough for me. My investigative nature and love for working with my hands pushed me towards dismantling and reassembling anything I could. This curiosity led me to experiment with the knowledge I gained from the devices I took apart and the books I read. From making my own electromagnets to building spring-loaded projectile launchers with my brothers, my passion for understanding and creating grew.
            Given these interests, it only seemed natural for me to become an engineer. This field allows me to channel the wonder my younger self had and realize its potential through the principles of science and mathematics. My engineering identity is driven by a need to understand how everything around me works and how the science behind it can be used to innovate and have fun. Engineering enables me to take my curiosity and turn it into practical, inventive solutions, combining my love for discovery with my desire to make an impact on the world.
