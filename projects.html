                        <h3>Line Following Robot</h3>
                        <p>The project aimed to develop a robot capable of navigating a maze, detecting objects, measuring their distance from lines, and returning to the closest object near a detect line.
                            My role involved designing the control system and localization using MATLAB. Responsibilities included:
                            Control System Design: Developing algorithms for accurate line-following.
                            Object Detection: Implementing methods to measure object distance from detect lines.
                            Localization: Creating a system for tracking the robot’s position and returning to the closest object.
                            Integration and Testing: Ensuring the cohesive operation of all components.

                        <h3>Prosthetics Assembly</h3>
                        <p>Working in a prosthetics clinic, assembling limbs and crafting sockets has been a profoundly rewarding experience for me. Each day, I dive into the meticulous process of customizing prosthetic limbs to meet the unique needs of each patient. It starts with taking precise measurements and creating custom molds for sockets to ensure a perfect, comfortable fit. Then, I assemble the limb components, integrating advanced materials and technology to ensure both functionality and durability. What I find most fulfilling is the chance to connect with patients personally—seeing them regain mobility and confidence in their daily lives is incredibly gratifying. This work is a unique blend of technical skill and compassionate care, and it’s a privilege to make such a meaningful impact on people’s lives.</p>
