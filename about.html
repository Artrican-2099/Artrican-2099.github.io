                    <h1>WHO IS LONGA</h1>
                    <p>While I take pride in my professional/academic accomplishments and skills, I believe that who I am extends far beyond what I do for a living. My core values—integrity, empathy, and continuous learning—are the foundation of my life. Outside of my career, I cherish spending time with family and friends, exploring new cultures through travel, and nurturing my passions for art, music and technology. Whether I'm relaxing in nature or experimenting with digital design, I find joy and inspiration in life's endless opportunities for creativity and growth. This holistic approach to life helps me stay balanced, fulfilled, and connected to the world around me.</p>

                    <h1>LONGA THE ARTIST</h1>
                    <p>Art, for me, is more than just a pastime; it’s a means of expression and a source of immense joy. Creating art allows me to explore my imagination, transform emotions into tangible forms, and connect deeply with my inner self. Whether it’s the soothing strokes of paint on a canvas or the intricate details of a pencil sketch, the process itself is both therapeutic and exhilarating. Art gives me a sense of freedom, a way to capture fleeting moments and ideas, making each piece a unique reflection of my journey and the world as I see it.</p>

                    <h1>LONGA THE CODER</h1>
                    <p>Web development and coding are my favorite forms of expression, where creativity meets technology. Through coding, I can create dynamic websites and applications that not only solve real-world problems but also embody my artistic vision. Each line of code is like a brushstroke on a digital canvas, bringing to life interactive elements and captivating designs. Web development allows me to build engaging user experiences and share my passion with a broader audience. Whether it’s crafting the perfect layout or coding a complex feature, the process fuels my imagination, turning ideas into reality.</p>
